<!-- CSS Specificity helps determine what style will be applied to the HTML element(s) when there are overlapping or multiple CSS rules.
 
The Cascade Algorithm
1.Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear(agar same selector h jaise sirf class diya h to jo sabse bottom me use hua h vo apply hoga)

2.Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match

ORDER:Inline Style > ID Selector > Class or Attribute Selector > Element Selector > Universal Selector.
Universal Selector: 0
Element selectors and pseudo-elements: 1 eg(<p>, <div>, <a>)
Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes: 10
ID selectors: 100
Inline styles: 1000

3.Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, or your authored CSS.

4.Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type.(website pr jaake import karo aur vha (color:red !importance) aisa likhdo to it gets highest priority).
An !important at the end of a CSS value gets a specificity score of 10,000 points. This is the highest specificity that one individual item can get

Q: a.harryclass.rohan-class[href]:hover {
  color: red;
}
Calculation:Element selectors: a contributes 1 point.
Class selectors: .harryclass and .rohan-class each contribute 10 points, totaling 20 points.
Attribute selector: [href] contributes 10 points.
Pseudo-class: :hover adds another 10 points.
so 1+10+10+10+10=41-->
